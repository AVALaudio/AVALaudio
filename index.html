												It's a Distortion Device that uses a custom transfer function, clipping the signal exactly like it displays.											
												It's ready to use, just click and drag on the sine wave to drive up your sound. As you see, when the wave reach the upper or lower limit, it folds on itself, and a new limit it set up, half of the past one, then it folds again, and again, and again, and.... The distortion you'll get will work in a very unique way on transients, preserving most of the fundamental frequency! Also the Auto Gain function will re-balance the gain, also following the envelope of the original sound.

												It's a Soft Clip device with various clipping function to choose from.
												It's ready to use, just choose a function and turn the "THS" dial down to start clipping your sound. Try to experiment with different function and listen how it will change the distortion from one to another: you’ll see your audio stream in the scope and the threshold clipping it; the two shapes bottom left are standard clipping (white) and soft clipping function in use (red).

												It's a mappable LFO device with two oscillators, where you can set their speed using ratios and get intuitive graphic response, and map them to any (enabled) parameter inside Ableton: as you'll map them, you'll get the exact values of the chosen param directly from Ableton's API. Use it as a drag & drop double lfo, to modulate values you don't want to be exactly the same, getting intuitive ratios and meeting points from the graph.

												It's a plate reverb dedicated to the italian composer Gino Marinuzzi Jr., who in 1963 defined with this term the reverb technique. It's based on the famous Dattorro (1997) digital plate reverb design, which returns a dry and, at the same time, deep and spacious sound, with the possibility, through modulations, to obtain more metallic and spicy sound. The algorithm has been simplified in its controls, allowing you to act on the different parametrics through the central panel, which provides the filtering and diffusion options, as well as a simple animation that responds to the rms value of the reverberated signal.

												It's a random panner where the movement is triggered by transient, detectable thanks to a threshold slider. The amount of pan is user settable with a custom range slider, also there is a pop up menu in which is possible to set the release between transient and how many values the random will generate. This free utility device is very helpful whenever we have a mono sound that you'd like to pan randomly on each event (the same an operator does with the random pan, or a simpler etc.) so you can get the same effect on every audio signal, even if it's an audio clip, a synthetizer etc. It also works on stereo signal, re-balancing the two channel, giving back a stereo movement effect.

											<p> It's a multi tap delay matrix, where each possible line (up to 8) is 
												integrated a high quality pitchshifter. The stereo signal is spread per channel in other 4 different pitchshifters, and through a patch bay you can connect the 8 channels inputs to different 8 outputs, or connect a single channel to multiple outputs, provided with delays which can be set in 3 different modes: ratio for time synced fraction in order to obtain crazy rhythm and polyrhythmic patterns; free to get unsynced delay times; and for last sync, to get repetitions of the first delay line. With this m4l you can shift and delay sounds, creating clouds of harmonization, or add
												ing some spice to drum patterns and toppers loops. With the device you'll find 4 presets ideas to start with.

												It's a grain delay where the grain size is random and the delay time is user settable as random, free sync or bpm sync. The grain envelope can be set by the user, allowing to generate impulsive or smooth grains. It also features a module consisting in four pitchshifters that allows the user to create evolving and very characteristic textures, thanks to the possibility of layering different ranges. At last it is also possible to generate big clouds through the reverberation module made of two macros, decay and dry wet: using them the user will be able to diffuse the sound up to complete freeze. The display color and the dots sizes correspond respectively to the send amount and the signal RMS, while its movement (random) depends on the tempo.

												The idea behind it was to have a realistic and usable piano soundboard that can be adjusted as desired, thanks to the few but very useful controls available that can be used as a creative and unique reverb system.
												The device relies on the physical model of a string, the waveguide introduced by Karplus and Strong. The Pianerb provides as many strings as the piano, including double strings etc, I/O equalization and a resonance system that emulates the material and size of the piano body.
